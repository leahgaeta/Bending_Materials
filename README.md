# Dynamics

This is a collection of selected lecture notes from my dynamics course using the text Dynamics, 14th Edition, R.C. Hibbeler.

These were studied in conjunction with the text's material and are based off of my professor's examples and teaching style, which I found most effective for comprehending the material in the text. *The final chapter on vibrations is best understood after brushing up on differential equations.*
